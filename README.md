Advanced-Calculator in Python3
Wrote a calculator program that will solve using PEMDAS in python 3.
Will do, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parenthesis, exponents, pi, e, phi

Getting Started
Should be able to make a pull request

Prerequisites
Install the latest version of Python, and an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studios
Once installed, the code is implementing unit testing, so must have the main.py and the test_calculator.py running as well to get
calculator.py to run

Running the tests
Once implemented, the code will run the unittest algorthms to ensure the calculator is working correctly

Break down into end to end tests
The test_calculator.py imports the unittest library for python 3
It will run case examples of possible questions that can be asked of the program and will have a written solutions.
The written solutions will be compared with the solutions calculated by the program to determine if the calculator
is working properly.

An example could be
4*(3+5)/2
following pemdas, the solution should be 16, which if added to test_calculator, the program can check if my given 16
is the same as the calculated value

Built With
Repl.it source code written
Microsoft Visual Studios for debugging
